                <h2>Who is Youssef Abdelhady ?</h2>
                <p>
                    Youssef Abdelhady is a driven Computer Science student at Marist College. Originally pursuing a Criminal Justice major, he had a realization that he didn't want to pursue a career in law enforcement. In a random move that had others speculating he was schizophrenic, he ventured into the world of computer science, completely unfamiliar with the subject and without any prior research. He embraced the challenges that came his way, acknowledging that this new path was more demanding than anything he had encountered before. With the support of inspiring professors and dedicated classmates, he persevered. Now, he is on track to graduate in December 2023. With a newfound passion for programming and problem-solving.
